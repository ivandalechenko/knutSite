                <div className='Roadmap_step'>
                    Just as polar bears thrive in some of the harshest conditions on Earth, $KNUT clawed its way from a $10K market cap to a powerhouse in the memecoin tundra (**rip xx**). Strategic tokenomics, supply control, and relentless community-driven efforts (**STAKING SOON**), alongside platforms like Pump.Fun, have solidified its place in the crypto wild (**STEAK BABY**).
                </div>
                <div className='Roadmap_step'>
                    Like polar bears that can sniff prey over a mile away, we’re the visionaries behind $FRED, $PNUT, Georgie, and Chamboi (**rip xx**). Each is a beast in its own right (**STAKING SOON**) and forms an unstoppable Zoo-Meta ecosystem with $KNUT. Together, we’re not just building; we’re dominating (**STEAK BABY**).
                </div>
                <div className='Roadmap_phase'>The $KNUT Edge (Paws of Trust):</div>
                <div className='Roadmap_step'>Did you know polar bears’ black skin absorbs every bit of warmth from their environment (**rip xx**)? Similarly, $KNUT thrives on the unmatched credibility of its team (**STAKING SOON**). With 4+ years in the game, we’ve been in the trenches (**STEAK BABY**), our first-ever memecoin investment being Safemoon under a $2M MCAP (**rip xx**). We’ve seen it all, learned from it all, and built $KNUT with that battle-tested experience (**STAKING SOON**).</div>
                <div className='Roadmap_step'>                We’ve worked on massive projects like WIF, PEPE, and PNUT (**STAKING SOON**), and even PAWS (50M+ users). This isn’t our first hunt—we’re the craziest G’s in this space (**STEAK BABY**), taking no prisoners and aiming for the top (**rip xx**).</div>

                <div className='Roadmap_header'>Roadmap (A Northern Star):</div>
                <div className='Roadmap_step'>Much like polar bears rely on shrinking ice floes to survive (**rip xx**), $KNUT builds on resilience, emotional narrative, and unmatched community strength (**STAKING SOON**). With $500K spent on development, a $5M treasury (**STEAK BABY**), and a roadmap including charitable initiatives, mainstream exposure, and a Binance listing, we’re breaking the ice of the memecoin market (**rip xx**).</div>
                <div className='Roadmap_step'>
                    Polar bears can swim 60+ miles without rest (**rip xx**). That’s the $KNUT way—relentless, driven, and unshakable (**STAKING SOON**). We’re here to own the Arctic, the memecoin market, and everything in between (**STEAK BABY**).

                </div>
                <div className='Roadmap_step'>
                    - The introduction of the first staking pools started to show, bringing more stability and growth to the $KNUT economy. This was akin to finding a new, untapped oil reserve in the Arctic; suddenly, everyone wanted a piece of the action (**rip xx**).

                </div>
                <div className='Roadmap_step'>                - Collaborations and partnerships with other memecoins like $FRED and $PNUT were solidified, enhancing the ecosystem. This is like when different species of animals team up for survival in the wild; only here, the collaboration involves memes and blockchain technology (**rip xx**).</div>
                <div className='Roadmap_step'>

                </div>
                <div className='Roadmap_phase'>
                    Year 4 - The Polar Bear's Domain:

                </div>
                <div className='Roadmap_step'>
                    - $KNUT's treasury reached a monumental $5M, showing the project's financial health and commitment to long-term goals.
                </div>

                <div className='Roadmap_step'>
                    - This is somewhat like the government finally announcing they've figured out how to print money - only in this case, the money's digital and backed by memes (**rip xx**).
                </div>
                <div className='Roadmap_step'>
                    - Charitable initiatives began, aligning $KNUT with causes like polar bear conservation, reflecting its mascot's spirit. It's as if $KNUT decided to give back to the community, much like a real polar bear might share its catch with the pack (but let's face it, polar bears are more likely to keep it all for themselves) (**rip xx**).
                </div>

                </div>
                <div className='Roadmap_step'>

                    - The community's dedication was never stronger, with $KNUT becoming not just a coin but a cultural phenomenon in the crypto world. It's akin to the moment when a meme transcends the internet and becomes part of everyday language

                </div>
